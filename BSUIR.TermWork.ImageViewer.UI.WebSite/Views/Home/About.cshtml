                A black hole is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything,
                including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts
                that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole.
                Around a black hole, there is a mathematically defined surface called an event
                horizon that marks the point of no return. The hole is called "black" because
                it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a
                perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum field theory in curved spacetime
                predicts that event horizons emit radiation like a black body with a finite
                temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the
                black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of
                stellar mass or greater.
